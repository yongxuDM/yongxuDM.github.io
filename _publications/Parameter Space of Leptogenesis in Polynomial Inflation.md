Polynomial inflation is a very simple and well motivated scenario. A potential with a concave ``almost'' saddle point at field value ϕ=ϕ0 fits well the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and makes testable predictions for the running of the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio. In this work we analyze leptogenesis in the polynomial inflation framework. We delineate the allowed parameter space giving rise to the correct baryon asymmetry as well as being consistent with data on neutrino oscillations.
