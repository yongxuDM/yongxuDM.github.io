We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum resulting from gravitonbremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. We focus on an inflaton ϕ oscillating around ageneric monomial potential V(ϕ) ∝ ϕn, considering two different reheatingscenarios: i) inflaton decay and ii) inflaton annihilation. We show that in the case of aquadratic potential, the scattering of the inflatons can give rise to larger GW amplitude than thedecay channel. On the other hand, the GW spectrum exhibits distinct features and redshifts ineach scenario, which makes it possible to distinguish them in the event of adiscovery. Specifically, in the case of annihilation, the GW frequency can be shifted to valueshigher than those of decay, whereas the GW amplitude generated by annihilation turns out to besmaller than that in the decay case for n ≥ 4, due to the different scaling of radiationduring reheating. We also show that the differences in the GW spectrum become more prominent withincreasing n. Finally, we highlight the potential of future high-frequency GW detectors todistinguish between the different reheating scenarios.
