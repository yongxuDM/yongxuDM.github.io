Probing Gravitational Dark Matter with Gravitational Waves
---
* Pure Gravitational Dark Matter (PGDM) is the most minimal DM scenario, but would be very  challenging for detection.
* PGDM can be unavoidably generated in the early Universe via annihilation of particles in the SM plasma, where the latter also emits GWs.

  <img src="/images/DMGW.png" alt="Editing a markdown file for a talk" width="600" height="300">
  
* Such unavoidable cogenesis and tight connection imply that the GWs can help to probe the spin $$s$$  and mass $$m_{\text{DM}}$$ of PGDM.
* For more information, see [2412.21137](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21137) and [Phys.Lett.B 865 (2025) 139483](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2025.139483)

Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating
---

* In [2407.03256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256), I systematically investigated the  ultra-high frequency GWs from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. The processes under consideration include: $$(i)$$ $$1 \to 3$$ graviton Bremsstrahlung, $$(ii)$$ $$2 \to 2$$ scattering of the inflaton and its decay products, $$(iii)$$ pure inflaton $$2 \to 2$$ scattering, and $$(iv)$$ one-loop induced inflaton decay.
* After a comprehensive comparison among the four sources of GWs, I identified the conditions under which dominant sources emerge.
* A meaningful step toward establishing a more precise framework for identifying and analyzing the key sources of high frequency GWs in the early universe.

Probing Reheating with Bremsstrahlung GW 
--
* This is a proposal based on one of my recent paper [2407.03256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256) to use High-frequency  Bremsstrahlung GWs to probe two important parameters:  inflaton mass $$m_\phi$$ and reheating temperature $$T_{\text{rh}}$$ 
* Amplitude of peak  $$\Omega_{GW}^{1\to3}h^2(f_{\text{peak}}) \simeq \mathcal{O} (10^{-18})    \left( \frac{m_\phi}{10^{13}~\text{GeV}}\right)^2$$ 
* Location of peak frequency $$f_{\text{peak}}\simeq 9.5 \cdot10^{9}\,\left( \frac{m_\phi}{10^{13}~\text{GeV}}\right)\, \left(\frac{ 10^{13}~\text{GeV}}{T_{\text{rh}}}\right) \text{Hz}$$

<!-- Gravitational Wave from Graviton Bremsstrahlung -->

<!--  * The poduction rate for a graviton with energy $$E_\omega$$  -->
  
<!-- <img src="/images/1to3_rate.png" alt="Editing a markdown file for a talk" > -->

<!-- where $$x \equiv E_\omega /m_\phi$$. A graviton can carry a maximum of half of the inflaton energy, which occurs when the daughter particle mass approaches zero. In such case, the differential decay rate tends toward zero as the phase space closes. This is why the differential decay rate goes to zero when $$x \to 1/2$$. When $$x\to 0$$, the spectrum $$\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega}  \to \infty$$, which is a well-known feature of (infrared) graviton Bremsstrahlung. To address such divergence, it is necessary to include vertex and self-energy diagrams, which is similar to the  situation in QED. Here, our main interest lies in quantities proportional to $$ E_\omega\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega} $$, so we do not need to worry about the divergence at this moment. -->

Letogenesis from 3-body Decay
--
We recently found a novel  channel for non-thermal   leptogenesis via inflaton 3-body decay [2401.02485](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02485).
The idea is very simple:

* One does not need to introduce (the traditional) $$\phi N N$$ coupling
* The only assumptions:
    * $$\phi H^{\dagger} H$$ for reheating
    * $$H \ell N$$  for neutrio mass via Type-I see-saw
      
Modular Symmetry and Cosmology
--
* Modular symmetry offers nice explanations for the flavor puzzle, neutrino masses and mixings in the standard model, where the Yukawa couplings are treated as modular forms. Modular forms, which are  holomorphic functions of the complex modulus $$\tau$$, of a specific level (e.g., $$\Gamma_3$$) have a fixed structure that can reproduce observed lepton mass and mixing patterns.
* The modular field $$\tau$$ could drive the exponential expansion in the early Universe. After inflation, energy can be transferred from $$\tau$$ to the standard model during reheating process.
* In a recent work [2411.18603](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18603), we offered the first attempt to simultaneously address the lepton flavor problem, inflation, post-inflationary reheating, and baryogenesis via leptogenesis utilizing the modular group $$A_4$$.
* In our setup:
  * Lepton masses and mixings can be explained at $$1~\sigma$$ level.
  * Light neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism.
  * Inflation is driven by the angular component of the modular field, $$\tau$$, evolving along the arc of the fundamental domain.
  * Reheating of Universe after inflation proceeds via $$\tau$$ decays into right handed neutrinos, Higgs and leptons.
  * Baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) could be explained from Barygenesis via leptogenesis.

Resonant Reheating
--
 * Tradiational reheating via inflaton contact interaction such as  $$ \phi h^2 $$,  $$ \phi^2 h^2 $$
 * For non-contact interactions, a massless graviton mediator has been discussed in lieterature
 * We explore reheating via inflaton annihilation via a massive mediator [2404.16090](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16090)
 * Novel features show up, including
   * Resonant production of radiation and non-trival temperature evolution
   * Interesting implications on particle physics pheno and cosmo

Dark Matter Production in the Early Universe
--
* Dark Matter can be produced both non-thermally and thermally in the early Universe.
<img src="/images/DM_Production.png" alt="Editing a markdown file for a talk" width="800" height="400">
* Considering all possible production channels can reveal interesting interplay between them, potentially altering the parameter space [2406.19447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19447) 


Cosmic Inflation 
--
* Most simple chaotic inflation model $$V(\phi) \sim \phi^p $$ with $$ p>1/2$$ has been ruled out by recent CMB experiments.
* A simple and straightforward extension is a polynomial inflation model with a potential $$V(\phi) = a \phi^2 + b \phi^3 +d  \phi^4  $$, which provides a good fit to the CMB data. It also predicts testable running of specal index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. See [2209.07545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07545) for analysis in large field regime and  [2104.03977](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03977) for analysis in small field scenario.

Refined Predictions for Starobinsky Inflation
---
* The Starobinsky model, proposed in 1980, is a remarkably simple and predictive inflationary scenario.

* We recently derived simple yet more accurate analytical approximations for the inflationary predictions, particularly for the spectral index $$ n_s $$, given by [2504.20757](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20757) 
$$ n_s \simeq 1 - \frac{2}{N_\star - \frac{3}{4} \ln (2/N_\star)}$$, $$ r \simeq \frac{12}{\left[N_\star - \frac{3}{4} \ln (2/N_\star)\right]^2} $$.

* These refined approximations can reproduce the commonly used expression in the literature, $$ n_s \simeq 1 - \frac{2}{N_\star} $$, $$ r \simeq \frac{12}{N_\star^2} $$, in the lagre $$ N_\star $$ limit. However, the commonly used approximations tend to underestimate the prediction for $$ n_s $$, potentially leading to misleading conclusions when comparing with precision observational data.

Black Hole Superradiance, Dark Sector and GWs
--

A spinning black hole can effectively transmit energy to its surroundings through superradiance. When the Compton wavelength $$\lambda_C =1/m  $$ of a particle matches the gravitational radius $$r_g = G M_{\mathrm{BH}} $$ of a black hole, the occupation number of the particles can undergo exponential amplification, resulting in the creation of "gravitational atoms" around the black hole. Superradiance condition: $$\frac{r_g}{\lambda_C}=G M_{\mathrm{BH}} \, m \simeq 0.38\left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^7 \mathrm{~g}}\right)\left(\frac{m}{10^7 \mathrm{GeV}}\right) \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$$. This implies interesting phenomenology between:

* Light BH and Heavy DM [2205.11522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11522)
* (Super) Heavy BH and (Ultra) Light DM üê£
* Effects of superradiance "gravitational atoms"  on waveforms of black hole binaries üê£
* GWs from "gravitational atoms" üê£

Primordial Black Hole Formation 
--
* Is it possible to have PBH formation within the SM framework?
* Yes. But we would need to fine-tune the top-quark mass to make the Higgs potential flat in the relevant region $$\sim 10^{17 -18}~\text{GeV}$$.
* If this occurs, it would lead to testable gravitational wave signatures that could be detected by DECIGO and BBO [1905.13581](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13581)
