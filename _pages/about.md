# 你好, Hello! Welcome to my web! 

My name is XU (徐) Yong (勇). I was born in Xinyang, Henan, China, famed for its exquisite Xinyang Maojian green tea. 🗣️ My mother tongue is the Xinyang dialect. I navigate between  Mandarin and English, and possess a surviving-level proficiency in German. Python 💻 is now my native language, through which I can express myself well. I earned my PhD 🎓 from the University of Bonn in October 2022 and currently research early Universe cosmology at JGU Mainz. Outside academia, I find peace in fishing 🎣.

Graviton Bremsstrahlung 
--
I am recently working on an interesting and unavoidable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from Graviton Bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. The idea is very simple:

* Inflaton decay $$\phi \mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}$$ with $\mathcal{F}\in \{ \varphi, \psi \}$ for bosonic and fermionic reheating
* Gravitational coupling $\frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} g_{\mu \nu}$
* Expand the metric $g_{\mu \nu} \simeq \eta_{\mu \nu} + \frac{1}{M_P}h_{\mu \nu}$, leads to a coupling among graviton and matter field $\frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} h_{\mu \nu}$
* Graviton production via Bremsstrahlung in a 3-body process $\phi \to \mathcal{F} \mathcal{F} h_{\mu \nu}$

 * Inflaton oscillating in a generic potential $ \phi^{n} $
 * Extended axion parameter space depends on both the value of $n$ and the type of inflaton matter coupling
