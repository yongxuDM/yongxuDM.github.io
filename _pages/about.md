# ‰Ω†Â•Ω, Hello! 

My name is XU (Âæê) Yong (Âãá). I was born in Xinyang, Henan, China, famed for its exquisite Xinyang Maojian üçµ green tea. üó£Ô∏è My mother tongue is the Xinyang dialect. I navigate between  Mandarin and English, and possess a surviving-level proficiency in German. Python üíª is now my native language, through which I can express myself well. I earned my PhD üéì from the [Universit√§t Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en) in October 2022 and currently postdoc at [Johannes Gutenberg-Universit√§t Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/en/), working on early Universe cosmology. Here is my

Gravitational Wave from Graviton Bremsstrahlung 
--
I am recently working on an interesting and unavoidable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from Graviton Bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. The idea is very simple:

* Inflaton decay via coupling $$\phi \mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}$$ with  $$ \mathcal{F} \in  \{ \varphi, \psi \} $$ for bosonic and fermionic reheating
* Gravitational interaction via coupling between energy momentum tensor and metric  $$\frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} g_{\mu \nu} $$
* Expand the metric  $$ g_{\mu \nu} \simeq \eta_{\mu \nu} + \frac{1}{M_P}h_{\mu \nu} \to  \frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} h_{\mu \nu} $$
* Graviton production via Bremsstrahlung in a 3-body process $$\phi \to \mathcal{F} \mathcal{F} h_{\mu \nu}$$

<!-- where $$x \equiv E_\omega /m_\phi$$. A graviton can carry a maximum of half of the inflaton energy, which occurs when the daughter particle mass approaches zero. In such case, the differential decay rate tends toward zero as the phase space closes. This is why the differential decay rate goes to zero when $$x \to 1/2$$. When $$x\to 0$$, the spectrum $$\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega}  \to \infty$$, which is a well-known feature of (infrared) graviton Bremsstrahlung. To address such divergence, it is necessary to include vertex and self-energy diagrams, which is similar to the  situation in QED. Here, our main interest lies in quantities proportional to $$ E_\omega\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega} $$, so we do not need to worry about the divergence at this moment. -->

Letogenesis from 3-body Decay
--
We recently found a novel  channel for non-thermal   leptogenesis via inflaton 3-body decay [2401.02485](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02485).
The idea is very simple:

* One does not need to introduce (the traditional) $$\phi N N$$ coupling
* The only assumptions:
    * $$\phi H^{\dagger} H$$ for reheating
    * $$H \ell N$$  for neutrio mass via Type-I see-saw

 * Inflaton oscillating in a generic potential $$ \phi^{n} $$
 * Extended axion parameter space depends on both the value of $$n$$ and the type of inflaton matter coupling

   
Black Hole Superradiance and Dark Matter
--

A spinning black hole can effectively transmit energy to its surroundings through superradiance. When the Compton wavelength $$\lambda_C =1/m  $$ of a particle matches the gravitational radius $$r_g = G M_{\mathrm{BH}} $$ of a black hole, the occupation number of the particles can undergo exponential amplification, resulting in the creation of "gravitational atoms" around the black hole. Superradiance condition: $$\frac{r_g}{\lambda_C}=G M_{\mathrm{BH}} \, m \simeq 0.38\left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^7 \mathrm{~g}}\right)\left(\frac{m}{10^7 \mathrm{GeV}}\right) \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$$. This implies interesting phenomenology between:

* Light BH and Heavy DM [2205.11522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11522)
  
* (Super) Heavy BH and (Ultra) Light DM
