# 你好, Hello! Welcome to my web! 

My name is XU (徐) Yong (勇). I was born in Xinyang, Henan, China, famed for its exquisite Xinyang Maojian green tea. 🗣️ My mother tongue is the Xinyang dialect. I navigate between English, Mandarin, and possess a surviving-level proficiency in German. Python 🐍 is now my native language, through which I can express myself well. I earned my PhD 🎓 from the University of Bonn in October 2022 and currently research early Universe cosmology at JGU Mainz. Outside academia, I find peace in fishing. Join me on a journey where curiosity knows no bounds 🌌.
