Hallo! Welcome to my webpage. My name is XU (徐) Yong (勇). I am originally from Xinyang, Henan, China. As a multi-planetary human being, Xinyang dialect is my mother language, and Python is my native language, in which I can express myself the best. I use Mandarin and English as working languages, and speak surviving-level German in my daily life.

I obtained my PhD from University of Bonn on October 2022. After that, I moved to JGU Mainz for  postdoc.
