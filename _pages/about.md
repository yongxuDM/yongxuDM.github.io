# 你好, Hello! Welcome to my web! 

My name is XU (徐) Yong (勇). I was born in Xinyang, Henan, China, famed for its exquisite Xinyang Maojian green tea. 🗣️ My mother tongue is the Xinyang dialect. I navigate between  Mandarin and English, and possess a surviving-level proficiency in German. Python 💻 is now my native language, through which I can express myself well. I earned my PhD 🎓 from the University of Bonn in October 2022 and currently research early Universe cosmology at JGU Mainz. Outside academia, I find peace in fishing 🎣.

Graviton Bremsstrahlung
--
I am recently working on an interesting and unavoidable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from Graviton Bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. The idea is very simple.

*  Inflaton decay $~\phi FF$ for reheating
*  Gravitational coupling $\frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} g_{\mu \nu}$
*  Expand the mextirc $g_{\mu \nu} \simeq \eta_{\mu \nu} + \frac{h_{\mu \nu}}{M_P}$
*  Grviaton production via Bremsstrahlung  in a 3-body process
