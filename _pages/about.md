Hallo! Welcome to my webpage. My name is XU (徐) Yong (勇). I am originally from Xinyang, Henan, China. I am currently a postdoc researcher working on particle cosmology at JGU Mainz. I obtained my PhD from Bonn in 2022, where I also did my master degree in 2018. [CV here](https://yongxudm.github.io/cv/)


My research
======
I am currently working an interesting and unavoidable stochastic gravitational wave background from Graviton Bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating.
