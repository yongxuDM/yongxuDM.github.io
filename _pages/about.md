# 🌟 Welcome to my vibrant corner of the web! 🌟


My name is XU (徐) Yong (勇). I was born in China, Henan, Xinyang, where the famous green tee-- Xinyang Maojian is produced.  Xinyang dialect is my mother tongue, and Python now becomes my native language, in which I can express myself well. For working, I use English and Mandarin. I can speak surviving-level German in daily life.  I obtained my PhD from University of Bonn on October 2022. After that, I moved to JGU Mainz for postdoc. I work on early Universe cosmology. I like fishing.
