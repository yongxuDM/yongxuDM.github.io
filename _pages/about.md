# 🌟 你好, Hello! Welcome to my web! 🌟


Hello! I'm XU (徐) Yong (勇), born in Xinyang, Henan, China, famed for its exquisite Xinyang Maojian green tea. Fluent in the Xinyang dialect and Python, I navigate between English, Mandarin, and a surviving-level German proficiency. I earned my PhD from the University of Bonn in October 2022 and now research early Universe cosmology at JGU Mainz. Outside academia, I find peace in fishing. Join me on a journey where curiosity knows no bounds!
