# ‰Ω†Â•Ω, Hello! Welcome to my web! 

My name is XU (Âæê) Yong (Âãá). I was born in Xinyang, Henan, China, famed for its exquisite Xinyang Maojian green tea. üó£Ô∏è My mother tongue is the Xinyang dialect. I navigate between  Mandarin and English, and possess a surviving-level proficiency in German. Python üíª is now my native language, through which I can express myself well. I earned my PhD üéì from the University of Bonn in October 2022 and currently research early Universe cosmology at JGU Mainz. Outside academia, I find peace in watching green fields and fishing üé£.

Graviton Bremsstrahlung 
--
I am recently working on an interesting and unavoidable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from Graviton Bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating. The idea is very simple:

* Inflaton decay $$\phi \mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}$$ with  $$ \mathcal{F} \in  \{ \varphi, \psi \} $$ for bosonic and fermionic reheating
* Gravitational coupling  $$\frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} g_{\mu \nu} $$
* Expand the metric  $$ g_{\mu \nu} \simeq \eta_{\mu \nu} + \frac{1}{M_P}h_{\mu \nu} \to  \frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} h_{\mu \nu} $$
* Graviton production via Bremsstrahlung in a 3-body process $$\phi \to \mathcal{F} \mathcal{F} h_{\mu \nu}$$

* The poduction rate for a graviton with energy $$E_\omega$$

where $$x \equiv E_\omega /m_\phi$$. A graviton can carry a maximum of half of the inflaton energy, which occurs when the daughter particle mass approaches zero. In such case, the differential decay rate tends toward zero as the phase space closes. This is why the differential decay rate goes to zero when $$x \to 1/2$$. When $$x\to 0$$, the spectrum $$\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega}  \to \infty$$, which is a well-known feature of (infrared) graviton Bremsstrahlung. To address such divergence, it is necessary to include vertex and self-energy diagrams, which is similar to the  situation in QED. Here, our main interest lies in quantities proportional to $$\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega} E_\omega$$, so we do not need to worry about the divergence at this moment.

 * Inflaton oscillating in a generic potential $$ \phi^{n} $$
 * Extended axion parameter space depends on both the value of $$n$$ and the type of inflaton matter coupling
