# ‰Ω†Â•Ω, Hello! 

My name is XU (Âæê) Yong (Âãá). I grew up in Xinyang, Henan, China. üó£Ô∏è My mother tongue is the Xinyang dialect. I navigate between  Mandarin and English, and possess a surviving-level proficiency in German. Python üíª is now my native  language, through which I can express myself well. I earned my PhD üéì from the [Universit√§t Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en) in October 2022 and currently postdoc at [Johannes Gutenberg-Universit√§t Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/en/).

My research focuses on the intersection of particle physics and cosmology. Motivated by curiosity and experimental advancements, I am particularly interested in investigating the physics from inflation to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), concentrating on both theoretical developments and experimental implications.

Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating

 <!-- <img src="/images/UHGW.png" alt="Editing a markdown file for a talk" width="800" height="400"> -->

* In [2407.03256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256), I systematically investigated the  ultra-high frequency GWs from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. The processes under consideration include: $$(i)$$ $$1 \to 3$$ graviton Bremsstrahlung, $$(ii)$$ $$2 \to 2$$ scattering of the inflaton and its decay products, $$(iii)$$ pure inflaton $$2 \to 2$$ scattering, and $$(iv)$$ one-loop induced inflaton decay.
* After a comprehensive comparison among the four sources of GWs, I identified the conditions under which dominant sources emerge.

Probing Reheating with Bremsstrahlung GW 
--
* This is a proposal based on one of my recent paper [2407.03256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256) to use High-frequency  Bremsstrahlung GWs to probe two important parameters:  inflaton mass $$m_\phi$$ and reheating temperature $$T_{\text{rh}}$$ 
* Amplitude of peak  $$\Omega_{GW}^{1\to3}h^2(f_{\text{peak}}) \simeq \mathcal{O} (10^{-18})    \left( \frac{m_\phi}{10^{13}~\text{GeV}}\right)^2$$ 
* Location of peak frequency $$f_{\text{peak}}\simeq 9.5 \cdot10^{9}\,\left( \frac{m_\phi}{10^{13}~\text{GeV}}\right)\, \left(\frac{ 10^{13}~\text{GeV}}{T_{\text{rh}}}\right) \text{Hz}$$

Gravitational Wave from Graviton Bremsstrahlung 
--
An unavoidable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is from Graviton Bremsstrahlung during inflationary reheating [2301.11345](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11345). The idea is very simple:

* Inflaton decay via coupling $$\phi \mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}$$ with  $$ \mathcal{F} \in  \{ \varphi, \psi \} $$ for bosonic and fermionic reheating
<!-- * Gravitational interaction via coupling between energy momentum tensor and metric  $$T^{\mu \nu} g_{\mu \nu} $$ -->
* Expand the metric  $$ g_{\mu \nu} \simeq \eta_{\mu \nu} + \frac{1}{M_P}h_{\mu \nu} \to  \frac{1}{M_P} T^{\mu \nu} h_{\mu \nu} $$
* Graviton production via Bremsstrahlung in a 3-body process $$\phi \to \mathcal{F} \mathcal{F} h_{\mu \nu}$$

<!--  * The poduction rate for a graviton with energy $$E_\omega$$  -->
  
<!-- <img src="/images/1to3_rate.png" alt="Editing a markdown file for a talk" > -->

<!-- where $$x \equiv E_\omega /m_\phi$$. A graviton can carry a maximum of half of the inflaton energy, which occurs when the daughter particle mass approaches zero. In such case, the differential decay rate tends toward zero as the phase space closes. This is why the differential decay rate goes to zero when $$x \to 1/2$$. When $$x\to 0$$, the spectrum $$\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega}  \to \infty$$, which is a well-known feature of (infrared) graviton Bremsstrahlung. To address such divergence, it is necessary to include vertex and self-energy diagrams, which is similar to the  situation in QED. Here, our main interest lies in quantities proportional to $$ E_\omega\frac{d\Gamma^{1\to 3} }{dE_\omega} $$, so we do not need to worry about the divergence at this moment. -->

Letogenesis from 3-body Decay
--
We recently found a novel  channel for non-thermal   leptogenesis via inflaton 3-body decay [2401.02485](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02485).
The idea is very simple:

* One does not need to introduce (the traditional) $$\phi N N$$ coupling
* The only assumptions:
    * $$\phi H^{\dagger} H$$ for reheating
    * $$H \ell N$$  for neutrio mass via Type-I see-saw

  
Resonant Reheating
--
 * Tradiational reheating via inflaton contact interaction such as  $$ \phi h^2 $$,  $$ \phi^2 h^2 $$
 * For non-contact interactions, a massless graviton mediator has been discussed in lieterature
 * We explore reheating via inflaton annihilation via a massive mediator [2404.16090](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16090)
 * Novel features show up, including
   * Resonant production of radiation and non-trival temperature evolution
   * Interesting implications on particle physics pheno and cosmo

Dark Matter Production in the Early Universe
--
* Dark Matter can be produced both non-thermally and thermally in the early Universe.
<img src="/images/DM_Production.png" alt="Editing a markdown file for a talk" width="800" height="400">
* Considering all possible production channels can reveal interesting interplay between them, potentially altering the parameter space [2406.19447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19447) 

Cosmic Inflation 
--
* Most simple chaotic inflation model $$V(\phi) \sim \phi^p $$ with $$ p>1/2$$ has been ruled out by recent CMB experiments
* A simple and straightforward extension is a polynomial inflation model with a potential $$V(\phi) = a \phi^2 + b \phi^3 +d  \phi^4  $$, which provides a good fit to the CMB data.

Black Hole Superradiance and Dark Sector
--

A spinning black hole can effectively transmit energy to its surroundings through superradiance. When the Compton wavelength $$\lambda_C =1/m  $$ of a particle matches the gravitational radius $$r_g = G M_{\mathrm{BH}} $$ of a black hole, the occupation number of the particles can undergo exponential amplification, resulting in the creation of "gravitational atoms" around the black hole. Superradiance condition: $$\frac{r_g}{\lambda_C}=G M_{\mathrm{BH}} \, m \simeq 0.38\left(\frac{M_{\mathrm{BH}}}{10^7 \mathrm{~g}}\right)\left(\frac{m}{10^7 \mathrm{GeV}}\right) \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$$. This implies interesting phenomenology between:
