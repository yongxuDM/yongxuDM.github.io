Gravitational wave (GW) can be sourced from Bremsstrahlung of gravitons due to  the unavoidable coupling between energy momentum tensor and metric.  In this talk, we investigate such  gravitational spectrum during inflationary reheating. We first outline the computation formalism, and then study the corresponding  GW spectrum considering inflaton oscillating around a potential $\sim \phi^{n}$ and different types of inflaton-matter couplings for reheating. Finally, we elaborate that how such Bremsstrahlung-induced GW can be used to probe the dynamics of inflationary reheating.
