This talk will explore the radiative graviton production via Bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay during inflationary reheating. We will begin by outlining the calculation of production rates and then shift focus to the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from Bremsstrahlung. We will investigate the contribution of SGWB to Delta Neff and discuss the potential detection prospects using microwave cavities and space-based GW detectors. Overall, this talk will provide insights into the physics of inflationary reheating and the potential for detecting the SGWB produced during this process.
